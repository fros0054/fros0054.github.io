        <h2>About Me</h2>
    </article>
    <p>My name is <strong>Rylan Frost</strong>. I am a pretty laid back person, I have been my whole life. When I was about 4 or 5 I started playing hockey, which quickly consumed my life. It became my main focus for thew majority of my childhood. I stopped playing hockey when I turned 15 or 16 as the result of a knee injury, but was able to find pleasure in gaming instead. I went to St. Philips Elementy School in Richmond. Going there allowed me to make some friends that I will know to this day. From there I went on to Sacred Heard Catholic Highschool. After just barely gettin by in highschool I had no idea what I wanted to do, So I did some reasearch and decided I wanted to get further education. I did this in order to reach my goal, to teach english in Japan.</p>
    <p>Teaching englihs in Japan is a massive goal in my life, I also want to travel and meet the woman of my dreams. So many things I would love to do. In order to get to Japan I need to first obtain a full bachelors degree. This will allow me get into the JET Programm (<i>Japan Exchange Teacher's Programm</i>) This will get me placed in a school and fly me over there free of charge. It would be a dream to teach in Japan and get to experience the culture and learn a new language. That pretty much sums up my life and where I want to get to. Thanks for reading :)</p>
