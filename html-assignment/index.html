        About Me
    </article>
    <p>My name is Rylan Frost. I am a pretty laid back person, I have been my whole life. When I was about 4 or 5 I started playing hockey, which quickly consumed my life. It became my main focus for thew majority of my childhood. I went to St. Philips Elementy School in Richmond. Going there allowed me to make some friends that I will know to this day. From there I went on to Sacred Heard Catholic Highschool.  </p>
